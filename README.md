# TWW Randomizer Tracker for Archipelago (AP)

This is an AP tracker for [The Wind Waker Randomizer](https://archipelago.gg/games/The%20Wind%20Waker). The original tracker was made by [wooferzfg](https://github.com/wooferzfg/tww-rando-tracker) with the AP version of this being modified by me.

## Build Instructions

Building and running the tracker locally requires you to install [Node.JS version 20 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone the repository by running the following in a command prompt:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephanimate2021/twwr-ap-tracker.git
```

Navigate to the index.html file and open it in your browser of choice to open the tracker.
