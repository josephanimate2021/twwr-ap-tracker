# TWW AP Randomizer Tracker

[![Build Status](https://github.com/josephanimate2021/twwr-ap-tracker/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/josephanimate2021/twwr-ap-tracker/actions)

This is a tracker for [The Wind Waker Archipelago Randomizer](https://archipelago.gg/games/The%20Wind%20Waker/info/en). For usage of this newer style tracker, you may run this locally as I can't get this branch to deploy with gh pages for some reason.

## Build Instructions

Building and running the tracker locally requires you to install [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone the repository by running the following in a command prompt:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephanimate2021/twwr-ap-tracker.git
```

Navigate to the `twwr-ap-tracker` folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd twwr-ap-tracker && npm install
```
You can then build and serve the tracker application:
```bash
npm start
```
After the server starts, you can go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to open the tracker.

## So, where is the URL for this tracker?
You may click [here](https://josephanimate2021.github.io/twwr-ap-tracker) to visit this tracker. For GH Pages, I am using the older style tracker along with the old code as that tends to like GH pages more than this app for some reason.

## I heard that there is also support for the older style tracker with working AP Support. Is that true?

Yes, there is an older style tracker that you may use if you wish. That one currently works as well as you expect it to. The current style tracker is still in the works.
The link to it is [here](https://josephanimate2021.github.io/twwr-ap-tracker/old)
